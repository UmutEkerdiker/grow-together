<h2>Description</h2>
An efficient learning tool for everyone.

As an aspiring web developer, I am a big fan of learning methods.
I found that Pomodoro Technique to be an excellent studying tool, therefore I created it in my application.
Alongside that, creating habits is one of the most powerful tools to develop new skillsets.
I've used "Don't break the chain" method for years for this purpose, therefore implemented it in my application as well.
Further developments can be made if found suitable by me to the learning process.

<h2>Functionalities</h2>

<h3>Authentication & Security</h3>
I've used passportjs for local and Google authentication methods to implement user registration as well as the sessions and cookies.

<h3>Pomodoro Timer</h3>
I've simply created a script using JavaScript to create a timer that will countdown from 25 minutes and will give you a 5 minute break. It will also count
the number of cycles you've gone through. I aim to connect this functionality with back-end to display the total number of cycles users' have studied so far
and create a leaderboard.

<h3>Don't Break the Chain</h3>
This was my favourite functionality to create! You add a new chain, and increase or decrease the subsequent days you've completed to form your habits and
keep yourself accountable! It is stored in the back-end, so your progress will stay there, no worries! It will also tell you your current streak and display
thropies for each day you compeleted your task!

Feel free to reach out to me for future functionalities. I aim to improve the design and styling in the upcoming days!
