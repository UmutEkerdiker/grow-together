An efficient learning tool for everyone.

As an aspiring web developer, I am a big fan of learning methods.
I found that Pomodoro Technique to be an excellent studying tool, therefore I created it in my application.
Alongside that, creating habits is one of the most powerful tools to develop new skillsets.
I've used "Don't break the chain" method for years for this purpose, therefore implemented it in my application as well.
Further developments can be made if found suitable by me to the learning process.
